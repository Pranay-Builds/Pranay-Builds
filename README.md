Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate developer with a love for building impactful projects and learning new technologies.

## 🚀 About Me

- 🌱 I’m currently learning **Django, NodeJS and Git**

- 💻 Started using Git before fully understanding it: I learned Git gradually and made some mistakes early on, like committing everything with git add . without reviewing. I’ve since learned that careful staging and commit messages are essential for good version control practices.

- **Languages:** HTML, CSS, JS, React, Tailwind, Basics of C (which i learned from cs50x), SQL, Lua, Python
